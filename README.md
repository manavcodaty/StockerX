**Beibo** is a **Python** library that uses several **AI prediction models** to predict **stocks returns** over a defined period of time. 

It was firstly introduced in one of my previous package called [**Empyrial**](https://github.com/ssantoshp/Empyrial).

## How to install üì•

```py
pip install beibo
```
  
## How to use üíª

  
```py
from beibo import oracle
  
oracle(
      portfolio=["TSLA", "AAPL", "NVDA", "NFLX"], #stocks you want to predict
      start_date = "2020-01-01", #date from which it will take data to predict
      weights = [0.3, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2], #allocate 30% to TSLA and 20% to AAPL...(equal weighting  by default)
      prediction_days=30 #number of days you want to predict
)
  
```
